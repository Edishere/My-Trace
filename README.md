Beginning

Today is the 23rd of May 2020. I have been shocked by myself when a professor asked me whether have personal information on Github. I have been learning to be as an engineer for maybe six years from when I became a university student in the year 2014, and I still have nothing record systematically. I stored my notes, my draft, my projects and anything else on my notebooks, my textbooks, separated scratch papers and of course my laptop and disk. It becomes very hard to review what I have done and what I have experienced.

It's time to restart my engineer career. I will record my learning stages and notes of any language, some open-source project I interest and my experience or personal bullshit.

Projects I participated in were unable to share due to property security, even they were immature works. Keep in mind, never share personal information and confidential works' content to strangers or on the internet.

That is all.

写在开头

今天是2020年5月23号。今天有个教授问我，GitHub上有东西吗，当时我整个人都傻了。作为一个理工科学生，2014年至今将近6年的“工程师”经历没能记录下来，实属遗憾，毕竟回头找自己曾经所学是件麻烦事啊。零零散散的学习记录，工程文件都繁杂的难以翻阅，更别提重新整理。如果手上的这台小黑去世的话，我的毕生所学就去了大半QAQ。

接下来会拿GitHub当blog来记录下学习过程，有时间的话或许还能review过去。

注意注意，保护好自身信息和不可公开的工程信息。

先写这么多吧。
